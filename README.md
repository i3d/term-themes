## alacritty,newwboat,vscode color themes aren't standalone files, just copy those to their configs.

## The chrome themes are for fun, so they aren't in webstore. You need to just unzip it and go to "chrome://extensions" and "load unpacked".

## color palette script is stolen from mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes.
