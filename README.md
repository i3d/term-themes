# term-themes

Terminal themes I created, to save and ease my eyes for lo000ong coding time. NOTEd that these themes are created under the assumption that the environment is reasonably in low light and/or dark condition. Most of the themes are with dark background and low contrast color palettes (of course, not all colors are in low contrast). The DarkerMatrix theme is chosen color palettes with even lower contrast, suitable for eyes working loooong time under low light/dark environment (e.g. if you are a night owl). If your working environment isn't in low light or dark (e.g. office, outdoor, etc with almost no shades), these themes might not be the best as you may have a hard time to see the screen.

### alacritty,newwboat,vscode color themes aren't standalone files, just copy those to their configs.

### The chrome themes are for fun, so they aren't in webstore. You need to just unzip it and go to "chrome://extensions" and "load unpacked".

### Vieb color themes are plain css files, just copy them to the colors dir and set the colorschema to `matrix` would work.

#### color palette script is stolen from mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes.
